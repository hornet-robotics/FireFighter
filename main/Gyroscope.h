////////////////////////TODO: be aware of problem
// if the robot is moved during the intialization of the arduino, the acceleration will be captured by 
// the sensor. Therefore, always start robot in a motionless state. Also check gyro output before doing
// any official runs to check it is correct. 

// If the sensor is moving during initialization then the gyro will linearly increase the angle which will 
// cause bad angle readings and turns. To solve issue, reupload the software or simply press the reset button on 
// the arduino. Turning the robot on and off sometimes doesn't solve the issue so the other methods are preferred.
